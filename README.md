# Topic Modeling for Grouped and Ungrouped Tweets
 
## Topic Modelling Steps:
1. Data Prep: Cleaned text data, removed stop words, and special characters.
2. Document-Term Matrix: Represented word frequencies.
3. Topic Modelling Algorithm: Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
4. Topic Interpretation: Examined top words in each topic.
5. Evaluation: Used coherence and perplexity.

## Preprocessing:
1. Removed spam tweets based on qScore and nScore.
2. Tokenized, lowered case, and cleaned text using regex.
3. Performed text preprocessing (stopwords, bigrams, trigrams, lemmatization).
